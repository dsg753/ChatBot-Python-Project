# Terminal-Based Chatbot
ðŸ¤– A simple terminal-based chatbot built with Python. 
It responds to predefined user inputs and greets users based on the time of day.

## Features
- **Predefined Responses**:
    - The chatbot responds to common inputs like "hi", "hello", "how are you", etc.
    - The responses are stored in a separate Python file (`responses.py`) for modularity.

- **Dynamic Greetings**:
    - Based on the current time of the day, the chatbot greets the user with "Good morning," "Good afternoon," or "Good evening."

- **User Interaction**:
    - Continuous user interaction until the user types "bye" to exit.

- **Customizable**: Users can "teach" the bot as much as they like.
- **Persistent Memory**: Learned responses are saved and reused across sessions.
- **Flexible**: Easy to extend by modifying the JSON file.
 
- ### How to Run
- You need Python 3.x installed on your system.
